/* Q14. Can we create a private constructor ?
 
  Yes, we can declare a constructor as private. 
  If we declare a constructor as private we are not able to create
   an object of a class. We can use this private constructor
   in the Singleton Design Pattern.
 Conditions for Private Constructor
A private constructor does not allow a class to be subclass.
A private constructor does not allow to create an object outside the class.
If all the constant methods are there in our class we can use a private constructor.
If all the methods are static then we can use a private constructor.
If we try to extend a class which is having private constructor
 compile time error will occur. */
