/*Q18.How local static variable is different from global static variable in java?

A local static variable is a variable that can maintain its
 value from one function call to another and it will exist 
 until the program ends.
When a local static variable is created, it should be assigned 
an initial value. If it's not, the value will default to 0.

A global static variable is one that can only be accessed in the
 file where it is created. This variable is said to have file scope.*/
