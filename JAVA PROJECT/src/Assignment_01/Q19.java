/*Q19. why we can't create private and protected class in java?

No, we cannot create class as private or protected.
It can be either public or default (no modifier). 
If it does not have a modifier, it is supposed to have a default access.

If a top-level class is declared as private the compiler will complain 
that the modifier private is not allowed here. This means that a
top-level class cannot be a private, the same can be applied to 
protected access specifier also.
Protected means that the member can be accessed by any
class in the same package and by subclasses even if they are in another package.
